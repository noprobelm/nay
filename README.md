# Not *Another* Yaourt

`nay` is a wrapper for pacman that includes support for AUR package management. It can be used in the same way as `pacman`, with additional features.


## USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
---
This project is a work in progress. Many commands are not supported, and behavior may be erratic during development. You should use a different package manager when doing important things with your system.

## Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/noprobelm/nay
```

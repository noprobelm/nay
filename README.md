# Not *Another* Yaourt

`nay` is a wrapper for `pacman` which includes support for AUR packages. It can be used in the same way as `pacman`, with additional features.


## USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
This project is a work in progress. Many commands are not supported, and behavior may be erratic during development. You should use a different package manager when doing important things with your system.

## Installation

Install directly from the AUR

```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/nay.git && cd nay && makepkg -si && cd ../ && rm -rf nay
```

Use your favorite AUR helper

```
yay nay
```

Use `pip`

```
pip install git+https://github.com/noprobelm/nay
```

## Supported Commands

To update all system packages:

`nay`

To install a package from a database/AUR query, run `nay` optionless:

`nay yay`
